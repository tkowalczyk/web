Configure the site to use the `docs` directory, either through the Pages build workflow or by checking in the generated files on a dedicated branch.\n3. Update the `basePath` value in `site.config.js` if you are hosting under a project subdirectory (e.g. `/my-blog/`).\n\n### Cloudflare Pages\n\n1. Create a Pages project and connect it to your repository.\n2. Set the build command to `npm run build` and the output directory to `docs`.\n3. Deploy, then take advantage of Cloudflare's global CDN and preview deployments.\n\nBoth hosts handle HTTPS, caching, and CDN distribution out of the box. With the generator doing the heavy lifting you can deploy confidently in minutes.",
