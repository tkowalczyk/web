This site is an experiment in building a fast, maintainable publishing workflow using nothing but Markdown, a sprinkling of Node.js, and pure browser-native technologies.\n\n## Why vanilla technologies?\n\nThe web has an incredible toolbox, but sometimes it is easy to forget how far you can go with the core platform. By skipping frameworks for the front end we:\n\n- Keep bundle sizes microscopic for quick page loads.\n- Reduce complexity so content creators can focus on writing.\n- Gain full control over every pixel without fighting someone else's abstractions.\n\n## What you can expect\n\nOver the next few weeks we will unpack how the generator works, how to extend it for your own needs, and how to deploy the final output with confidence. You can look forward to:\n\n1. Deep dives on the build pipeline powering this site.\n2. Practical guides for authoring content in Markdown.\n3. Deployment recipes for popular static hosting providers.\n\nThank you for stopping by on day one. Subscribe to the RSS feed to follow along as we keep pushing the limits of a framework-free blog.",
