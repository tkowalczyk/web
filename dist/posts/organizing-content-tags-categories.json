Think \"Engineering\", \"Content Strategy\", or \"Productivity\".\n- **Tags** capture more granular concepts such as \"metadata\", \"deployment\", or \"CLI tooling\".\n\nBy combining both, we make it trivial to surface related material without implementing client-side routing or complicated search engines.\n\n## Building the taxonomy index\n\nDuring the build process we gather every tag and category, group the posts, and generate dedicated listing pages. Each page inherits the same layout and exposes links back to the original articles. Because everything is statically rendered there is no need for hash-based routing or runtime fetches—links are simple, descriptive URLs.\n\nWhen you publish your own content, invest a few seconds in tags and categories.
